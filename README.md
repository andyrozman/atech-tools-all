# Atech-Tools-ALL
ATech Tools is set of libraries intended for help with development on different platforms. Java solution is implemented in separate project: atech-tools, so java folder here is not accurate as of 4th April 2024. 

## Origins
This is helper library I was implementing since I started working in Java (back on 2000). 

## History
This repository was hosted on sourceforge.net for quite a while and it moved from different types of repositories 
(CVS -> SVN -> GIT) and now its been moved her, because of much better availability and build options support.

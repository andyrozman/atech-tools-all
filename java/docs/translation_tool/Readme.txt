1. Introduction
================

(Simple) Translation Tool (in further text TT) is tool for translation of application files 
intended for internationalization of (java) applications. 


2. Quick description of how application works
===============================================

!!!!
Application works by reading module 
configuration file (which is supplied by software vendor/developer), this file simply tells 
which module/application we are translating for. Next are so called master files, which are 
files that developers create, when making application (this are files containing mostly words
to translate and also some special codes which enable us to read file and translate it). 
Both master file and translation file can also have configuration files, but this is used just 
internally (this file must not be deleted).
